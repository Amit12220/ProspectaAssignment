Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?

Ans-while creating I would consider:-

1.My Api should be secure(Spring security as well as other security) so that no one able to misuse it.
2.should handle Exception so that user will not face difficulty.
3.application should be created with less boiler plate code so that it can be easily understandable.
